**Name:** *Du Junye* &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  **SID:** *56641800*
****
**Python Verison and Package version:**  
+ Python 3.9.7
+ Numpy 1.21.5 
****
**Note:** *The program is in the format of jupyter notebook, which consists of two part, the first one is source code part, another is result comparison. (all the experiment data are generated from the code)*
